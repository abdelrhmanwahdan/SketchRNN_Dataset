# SketchRNN Dataset
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the SketchRNN dataset then after that I am classifying the vector drawings by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. classifying vector drawings using:
    - convolutional neural network (CNN)
    - recurrent neural network (RNN)
